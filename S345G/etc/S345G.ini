# Topology
# S3 has three mechanisms to load topology information and will use the first satisfied below.
# 1 - NumNodes
#  create the specified number of nodes
# gNodeBId will be x
#  nodes named Node_0000x_CUCP, Node_0000x_CUUP, Node_0000x_DU
# 2 - UseTopologyList
#   read the named file with topology file list
# 3 - TopologyDir
#   read the JSON topology files in the specified directory

# if numNodes is specified, then S3 will create the specified number of nodes
 numNodes=1

# UseTopologyList
#
# specify a csv with the minimal information required.
#  The first none comment line will contain the mcc,mnc to use
#  each following none comment line will have the eNodeB name, the eNodeB id, the number of cells.
# ignored if numNodes has been specified
#UseTopologyList="etc/topologyFile.txt"

# If TopologyDir is set to a path containing json topology files, they will be parsed
# and used to create the topology for S3
TopologyDir="topology"

# If TopologyDir is set to a path containing json topology files, and require to map cell relation then mention event list which denote HO Type parameters.

# If LogCTRPath is specified,
# write CTR files to that directory

# Warning! - A file is created per Network Function, if a large number of nodes has been selected,
# S3 can quickly cause exhaust available file handles causing "Too many open files" errors.
#LogCTRPath = "output"

# Symbolic link handling
# If LogCTRPath has been specified to generated CTR files
# then specifying SymLinkPath will create symbolic links in the specified directory
# that point to the CTR files. These wil be created when the CTR file is closed and is therefore
# safe to be read and processed.
# If it doesn't exist, the links won't be created.

# number of timeslots in scheduler queue.

# RunFor, if present and not zero is time (in seconds) to run for.
# after which, it will stop generating new calls and wait for
# cooldown=45
# =((DistMonitor*QueueSize)/1000) seconds for already scheduled events to be sent.
 RunFor=120
cooldown=2

#
# busy hour control
#
# On the hour(local time), S3 will check if there is a setting here for that hour
# and if there is, it will change the target number of calls per second by the
# specified percentage. i.e. at 1 in the morning, if there is a value for hour1=33,
# the rate will be adjusted to 33% of the NumCallsPerSec value.
#
# Note - a value of zero means DO NOT CHANGE the current rate. This allows rates to be
# specified that have no impact and so can be overridden on the command line.
#
#hour1=33 # starting from 1 am, the call rate is 33% numCallsPerSec
#hour8=100 # starting from 8 am, the call rate is 100% numCallsPerSec
#hour11=33 # starting from 11 am, the call rate is 33% numCallsPerSec
#hour16=100 # starting from 4 pm, the call rate is 110% numCallsPerSec
#hour19=33 # starting from 7 pm, the call rate is 33% numCallsPerSec

#
# LoadControlFile
#
# This mechanism allows external processes to change the load being produced by S3.
# If set, S3 will monitor the named file and if it is detected and it contains
# a number, then S3 will attempt to change the numCallsPerSec by that percentage
# such that TargetCallsPerSec = NumCallsPerSec * (adjust * 0.01)
# S3 will only look for the file once every ten seconds.
# S3 will delete the file after it has read it but will not act on the file if
# the delete fails or the current load is not stable.
# This mechansim overrides any busy hour adjustment.
# Example:
# Given
# LoadControlFile="/tmp/loadControl.myInst"
# the command "$ echo 120 > /tmp/loadControl.myInst"
# would cause S3 to run at 120% of the numCallsPerSec
# LoadControlFile="/tmp/loadControl.myInst"

#
# Call duration rules setup
#
# Up to 99 rules numbered Duration1 to Duration99
# that give the length of the call and the number of calls of that length
# call length at least 1
# Only first 1000 call rules will be used.
# NOTE : At least one duration rule is required.
#Duration1=1,195   # 192 calls of 1 second
#Duration2=2,146   # 144 calls of 2 seconds
#Duration3=5,98     # 96 calls of 5 seconds
#Duration4=10,98
#Duration5=12,81
#Duration6=15,293
#Duration7=20,63
#Duration8=35,6

[Paths]
# Specify the pattern and times used per cycle
# eg callsetup2release.pat=10
# means the pattern is used at least ten times per cycle
# total number of patterns in a cycle is the sum of the
# times used
# -or-

# directory containing patterns to use and where to look for PatternINIFileName
PatternDir="patterns/testPatterns"

# Pattern configurations can be maintained in separate ini file as below. S3 will look for the file in the specified "PatternDir"
# and load the patterns along with patterns listed in S345G.ini file.
# For example :
PatternINIFileName="patterns.ini"
